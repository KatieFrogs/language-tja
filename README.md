# Install
Navigate to the [package page](https://atom.io/packages/language-tja) and click Install, or search for the `language-tja` package in the Atom settings.

# Configure
In the Atom settings, select Packages, and search for `language-tja`. In the package settings you can turn off colored circles to instead appear as plain text, and turn off aligning notes within measures.

# Additional Features
Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P, and input "tja" to access tools and quick setting toggles for this package.

# Troubleshooting
If the Japanese text looks broken in your TJA files, you can either manually change the encoding to Shift JIS in the Atom statusbar, or install the [default-encoding](https://atom.io/packages/default-encoding) package to fix the encoding automatically.
